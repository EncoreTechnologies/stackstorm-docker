# Change Log

# 2.0.0

- Replaced the depracated docker-py module with newer docker module
- Updated Docker API version from 1.13 to 1.41
- BREAKING CHANGE: The docker image push and pull functions from the API no longer support the insecure_registry parameter so that variable was removed from those respective actions
- Added the following actions:
  - `container_exec` - Run a command inside the given container. Similar to docker exec.
  - `container_get` - Return the container object from the given name or ID. Return None if the container does not exist
  - `container_run` - Run a container. By default, it will wait for the container to finish and return its logs, similar to docker run
  - `container_start` - Start the given container. Similar to the docker start command, but doesnâ€™t support attach options.
  - `container_stop` - Stop the given container
  - `image_get` - Return the image object from the given name or ID. Return None if the image does not exist
- Added unit tests for all actions
